# aa_haulers

___

A slide down viewer I made for [American Apparel's Hauler campaign](http://store.americanapparel.net/the-american-apparel-haul_cat1820693)

Another implementation was for their [Women's Day Page](http://store.americanapparel.net/women-s-day_cat2010300)

*Data is hardcoded into the index page in this repo. We used mustache for templating out the frontend in production.
